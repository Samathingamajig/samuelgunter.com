I made a website (hint: it's this one).

If you're reading this, you're probably on the website. If you're not, you should be. It's pretty cool.

For a long time I avoided making a personal website because I am horrible at design (but if you give me a design, I can implement it), so I didn't want to make something that was ugly. At the same time, I wanted to avoid templates because that seems cheesy.

I decided that it doesn't matter if I didn't make the design, so I used [`satnaing/astro-paper`](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) as a starting point. It has both light and dark modes, blogging, searching, and more already set up, as well as my biggest fear: a responsive navbar. It's flexible enough to where I can make it my own. Eventually I'll probably restyle it, but that day is not today.

For example, it has blogging but it doesn't have anything portfolio-wise for presenting projects. I'll be able to add that in the future.

Another thing I'd like to have is runnable snippets, similar to Stack Overflow's [Stack Snippets](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/358992/12101554). I'll probably be able to find something like that.

I don't know how to end this post so let's just end it here.
